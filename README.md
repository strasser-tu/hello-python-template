# Hello Python – PET Academy Assignment

Welcome to your first assignment at the **PET Academy**!  
In this exercise, you'll write a simple Python function to greet a user by name.

## Task

Implement the function `hallo(name)` in the file `hello.py`.

### Example:

```python
>>> hallo("Alice")
'Hallo, Alice!'
```

You can test your function by running:

```bash
python hello.py
```

## Run the tests

This repository includes a test file `test_hello.py`.

To run the tests locally:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

Or just run:

```bash
python test_hello.py
```

## Autograding

Your assignment will be automatically tested using **GitHub Actions**.  
Make sure the tests pass – you’ll see feedback in the "Actions" tab or on the pull request.

## Tips

- Stick to the function signature: `def hallo(name):`
- Make sure the function returns a string (don’t just `print` it!)
- Feel free to get creative with the greeting – but don’t break the tests ;)

Happy coding – and remember: Privacy begins with good functions.
